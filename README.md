Yummr (A Yelp Clone)

Your project idea
My idea is a Yelp clone that will have full CRUD capabilities, as well as multiple API integrations. Users will be able to search for local restaurants using their zip code and create a favorites list. Additional capabilities will include a Google API that will be able to show locations on a map..

Your tech stack (frontend, backend, database)
For my project I plan to use a MERN stack, so using MongoDB for my server, Express and Node for my routing, and React for my front end.

List of backend models and their properties
Current models include:
Restaurant: Name, Cuisine, Location, Price Rating, Rating
User: Name, Email, Location, Zip, Admin

React component hierarchy (if applicable)
React components will include:

Layout
Navbar
Restaurant (Single Item Structure)
Restaurant's(All items Structure)

User stories
-Users will be able to log into the website with admin access
-Users will be able to view restaurants near them using the Yelp API
-User will be able to add restaurants to their favorite's list
-Users will be able to fully edit their favorite's list.

Anything else your squad lead should know
Stretch goals include integrating the Google Maps API so that users can see their favorites on a map. If possible an AD API would be great to more closely imitate the Yelp website.
